# Vulkan_Triangle
A minimal Vulkan project that renders a single triangle using a fully manual graphics pipeline.
Includes instance & device setup, swapchain creation, render pass configuration, graphics pipeline setup, vertex buffers, command buffers, and synchronized drawing.

Built as a learning-focused reference for understanding the core Vulkan rendering flow from scratch — no helper libraries beyond GLFW for windowing.
